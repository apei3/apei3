Hi, I'm Ailun Pei.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on some fun side projects involving interactive visualizations, self-tracking tools, and creative coding experiments.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning computer graphics, shader programming, data visualization, and algorithms. I've also been tinkering with D3.js and refining my design-to-code workflow.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on creative tech projects that blend art and codeâ€”especially ones with a visual or interactive twist.

ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with making deep learning models more interpretable and designing intuitive user interfaces for data-driven tools.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creative coding, building structured-yet-flexible systems in Notion, or how I use data and routines to stay grounded and curious.

âš¡ Fun fact: I track glucose, mood, and training recovery to align my work rhythms with my biologyâ€”like running my own little lab
